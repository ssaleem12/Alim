# Alim Gaulani - Portfolio

This project is created for a friend when he wanted to show some of his work. I created the portfolio using my information so he can edit when he finishes learning Intro to Programming at DePaul University. This project was originally a blog but once I finished college, I redid it to make it a portfolio. It really helped me increase my skills in CSS as well as learn new techniques. 

In order to open this webpage all you have to do it launch the index.html in any web browser. I added it a navigation bar for single screen which makes it easier to scroll through.
