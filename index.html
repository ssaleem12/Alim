						<p>Hello, my name is Alim Gaulani. I am currently a Senior at Depaul University pursueing a degree in Sports Management. Some of my hobbies are playing sports, video games and volunteering in my community. This blog will discuss topics that challenge our beliefs and talk about my experience in college. In the future, I would like to work for the Chicago Bears but have no foundation on what I need to do. Avoid overly simplified ideas. You are a human being after all, and your life is not as simple as it may seem after years of school. You wouldn’t want to seem or sound too simple. The more substance you create out of your daily activities, the better. Longer sentences will be good. Include a few dream-like paragraphs to stress the point that you are not a robot. Sometimes it can get hard explaining your feelings and emotions, you may say. The best way to get to know people is to see how they react to stimuli. Use your essay to pick a few incidents or just more or less regular events to attempt and define what your character is at its core. Find amusing in ordinary and showcase that. Your job is to present the ordinary stuff that happens to you in a way that will make the reader want to know you better. It’s all a matter of the right perspective. You have to take multiple stands on what you are as a person, and include that all in an ordered form. How do you fit with your friends, family and just immediate surrounding? Where is your place in the world? What is the purpose of your life? If a question like that is too global for your work, you can just include the things that you enjoy.
